# Waters Automation Portal - Clean Implementation

## What Was Wrong

The original automation portal driver contained **lots of unnecessary functionality** that had nothing to do with sample transfer:

### ❌ **Removed Functionality** (Not Portal-related):
- `start_run()` / `stop_run()` / `abort_run()` - Chromatography run control
- `set_flow_rate()` / `set_temperature()` - Pump and oven control  
- `set_pressure()` / `set_gradient()` - Method parameters
- `get_data()` - Chromatographic data retrieval
- `inject_sample()` - Direct injection control
- Various chromatography monitoring functions

### ✅ **Actual Portal Functions** (Sample Transfer Only):
- `extract_drawer(tray_position)` - Remove drawer from position 0 or 1
- `insert_drawer(tray_position)` - Insert drawer to position 0 or 1  
- `get_status()` - Get system, door, drawer, and tray status
- `initialize()` - Initialize portal after startup or errors
- `report_version()` - Get system version information
- `reset_system()` - Reset the portal system
- `is_drawer_present()` - Check if drawer is currently present
- `is_door_open()` - Check if access door is open

## What the Automation Portal Actually Does

Based on the **Waters Automation Portal PC Protocol Specification (715008839)**:

> The Automation Portal provides **automated access to sample drawer/tray slots** for sample handling. It is specifically designed to move samples **in and out** of the instrument.

### Core Operations:
1. **Extract** - Move drawer out of instrument for sample access
2. **Insert** - Move drawer back into instrument for analysis
3. **Status** - Monitor drawer, tray, and door positions
4. **Initialize** - Set up system for operation

### Status Information:
- `system_mode` - Current operational mode
- `drawer_tray_status` - Drawer and tray presence ("DrawerAndTray", "DrawerOnly", "NoDrawerNoTray") 
- `door_status` - Door position ("DoorOpened", "DoorClosed", "DoorIntermediate")
- `move_state` - Current movement operation state
- Network information (IP, MAC address)

## Protocol Details

### Command Format:
```
Extract(sequence_number, tray_position)
Insert(sequence_number, tray_position)  
GetStatus
Initialize(sequence_number)
ReportVersion
ResetSystem
```

### Response Format:
```
Received(seq, command_name)
Completed(seq, command_name, [result])
Error(seq, command_name, error_code, error_description)
Status(seq, system_mode, move_cmd, move_state, drawer_tray_status, door_status, feeder_status, ip, mac)
```

## Example Workflow

```python
from automation_portal_driver import AutomationPortalDriver

# Connect and initialize
with AutomationPortalDriver(port='COM1') as portal:
    # Initialize system
    portal.initialize()
    
    # Extract drawer for sample loading
    portal.extract_drawer(0)  # Position 0
    
    # User loads/unloads samples manually
    input("Load your samples, then press Enter...")
    
    # Insert drawer back for analysis
    portal.insert_drawer(0)
    
    # Check final status
    status = portal.get_status()
    print(f"Ready for analysis: {status['drawer_tray_status']}")
```

## Files Changed

### Core Driver:
- `automation_portal_driver.py` - **Completely rewritten** to focus only on sample transfer
- `automation_portal_driver_old.py` - Backup of original (bloated) version

### Examples:
- `example_usage.py` - **New focused examples** showing only sample transfer operations  
- `example_usage_old.py` - Backup of original examples

### Test Files:
- All test files were already updated to use correct imports

## Key Benefits

1. **Focused Purpose** - Only does what an Automation Portal should do
2. **Cleaner API** - No confusing chromatography functions mixed in
3. **Proper Protocol** - Based on actual Waters specification document
4. **Better Documentation** - Clear purpose and usage examples
5. **Easier Maintenance** - Much smaller, focused codebase

## Summary

The Automation Portal is **not a chromatography controller** - it's a **sample transfer device**. The clean implementation properly reflects this purpose and provides a focused, easy-to-use interface for automated sample handling operations.
